(ns printbind.advisor
  "Print Finishing and Binding Worker Advisor — proposing a workshop
  scheduling/logistics coordination operation (log a work record,
  schedule a crew operation, flag a safety concern, coordinate a
  binding-materials supply order) from a crew roster, workshop
  registration and safety-reporting policy. Swappable mock/llm; the
  advisor ONLY proposes — `printbind.governor` independently gates
  every proposal and always escalates safety concerns and
  above-threshold supply orders. The advisor never proposes to
  directly finalize a finishing/binding-execution decision (e.g. a
  specific guillotine-cutting, folding or binding operation) or to
  override a shop safety officer's judgment — those stay permanently
  out of this actor's scope. Modeled on cloud-itonami-isco-7213's
  advisor (physical-safety-domain shape: blade/guillotine hazards and
  machine-pinch hazards on cutting/folding/binding equipment instead
  of cutting/forming hazards).
