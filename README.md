# cloud-itonami-isco-7323

Open Occupation Blueprint for **ISCO-08 7323**: Print Finishing and Binding Workers.

This repository designs a forkable OSS business for a print-finishing and bindery workshop scheduling and logistics coordination practice: a workshop scheduling and supply-coordination robot manages crew/task records under a governor-gated actor, so a print finishing and binding crew keeps its own operating records instead of renting a closed workforce-management SaaS.

**Maturity: `:implemented`.** `src/printbind/` implements the
`PrintBindWorkerActor` as a `langgraph.graph/state-graph`
(`printbind.actor`) wired to a `Print Finishing and Binding Worker
Advisor` (`printbind.advisor`) and an independent
`PrintBindWorkerGovernor` (`printbind.governor`), following the
itonami actor pattern (ADR-2607121000): `:intake -> :advise -> :govern
-> :decide -+-> :commit (:ok?) +-> :request-approval (:escalate?,
human-in-the-loop interrupt) +-> :hold (:hard?)`. 21 tests / 45
assertions green (`clojure -M:test`). HARD invariants (always hold,
never overridable): worker provenance, workshop provenance,
no-actuation (`:effect` must be `:propose`), a closed op-allowlist
(`:log-work-record`, `:schedule-crew-operation`,
`:flag-safety-concern`, `:coordinate-supply-order` — nothing else may
ever be proposed), and a permanent, unconditional block on any
proposal that would directly finalize a finishing/binding-execution
decision (e.g. deciding to proceed with a specific guillotine-cutting,
folding or binding operation) or override a shop safety officer's
judgment. Always-escalate paths (human sign-off regardless of
confidence, mapping this repo's Trust Controls in
[`docs/business-model.md`](docs/business-model.md)):
`:flag-safety-concern` (always) and `:coordinate-supply-order` above
the registered cost threshold.

## Robotics premise

All cloud-itonami verticals are designed on the premise that a **robot performs
the physical domain work**. Here a workshop scheduling/logistics coordination robot performs crew scheduling, task/materials-usage/progress-record logging and binding-materials supply-order coordination for a print finishing and binding crew, under an actor that proposes actions and an independent **Print Finishing and Binding Worker Governor** that gates them. The governor never
dispatches hardware itself, never performs print-finishing/binding work on the shop floor, and never finalizes a finishing/binding-execution decision or overrides a shop safety officer's judgment; `:high`/`:safety-critical` actions (such as a flagged blade-hazard/guillotine-hazard/machine-pinch-hazard/equipment-condition concern, or an above-threshold supply order) require human sign-off. **This actor coordinates workshop scheduling/logistics only — it never performs print-finishing/binding work itself.**

## Core Contract

```text
crew roster + workshop registration + safety-reporting policy
        |
        v
Print Finishing and Binding Worker Advisor -> Print Finishing and Binding Worker Governor -> log/schedule/coordinate, or human sign-off
        |
        v
robot actions (gated) + operating records + audit ledger
```

No automated advice can dispatch a robot action the governor refuses, finalize
a finishing/binding-execution decision, override a shop safety officer's
judgment, suppress an operating record, or disclose sensitive data
without governor approval and audit evidence.
